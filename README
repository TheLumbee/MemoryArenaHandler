# About

This library provides an efficient way to create, manage, and use memory areans in any application.

Written in C++, and exported for C use as well, it was designed with performance in mind.

## How to Build

### Simply -- Build with Current Build Script (Clang Compiler is required)

#### Required Dependencies

Clang++, Python, Ninja, and CMake (>= 3.20)

#### Command

Simply run `python build.py` for the release build or `python build.py -b debug` for the debug build.

### With CMake -- Run from within project root

#### Required Dependencies
CMake and a C++ compiler

`cmake -S . -B build`
`cd build`
`cmake --build . --parallel`

### What are the zig variables in the CMakeLists.txt file?

[Zig](https://ziglang.org/) is a systems programming language, coupled with the ability to cross compile C/C++ using LLVM(clang/clang++).

It has the ability to compile from any host to any target, it's pretty neat.

For this reason, this library can be compiled to any target if the `-DTARGET` argument is passed into CMake.

This makes it extremely simple for embedded development or targeting any LLVM supported architecture.

For example, I can run these commands:

`cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DTARGET=x86_64-windows -DSYSTEM=Windows`
`cd build`
`cmake --build . --parallel --target memory_arena_handler_shared`

and a x86_64 Windows library will be compiled from any host.

The same can be said of MacOS targets, other Linux targets with different architectures or glibc versions, and other Windows targets.

#### Note for mobile targets

iOS and Android can be targeted as well (and I'm assuming WASM although I haven't tried), but the mobile targets need additional resources (iPhone SDK for iOS and NDK for the needed Android version) for this to work. This hasn't been tested for this library.

Zig must be installed (see the zig link above) for this capability.

Once zig is installed, `zig targets` can be run to see a list of all the support targets/architectures.

The result of this list is large, so grep (or any equivalent) is recommended for desired targets.

#### Note for cross compilation

GoogleTest is used for this library. Compilation will likely fail with linker issues due to various macros and the standard library.

When cross compiling make sure to pass `--target memory_arena_handler_<shared/static>` into the cmake build command. This builds the library but not the tests.
